Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
Servings: 8

Ingredients:
2 medium green bell peppers
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)
1 medium red bell pepper
3/4 lb. pasta (rigatoni or your favorite shape)
1 (28 oz.) can petite diced tomatoes
1 tsp salt (or to taste)


Directions:
1. Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot.
2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
3. While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic.
4. Once the sausage is browned, remove it from the pot and add the peppers, onions, and garlic.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
6. After the peppers and onions have softened, return the sliced sausage to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper.
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
10. Stir to combine, place a lid on top, and allow the pasta to cook in the pepper sauce for about 5 more minutes, or until it has absorbed most of the liquid in the pot.
11. Add about a half teaspoon of salt, taste, and add more if needed.
