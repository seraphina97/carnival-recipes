Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------

Ingredients:
2 medium green bell peppers
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)

Directions:
1. Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot.
2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
3. While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
